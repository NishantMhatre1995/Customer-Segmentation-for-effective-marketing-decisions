# Customer-Segmentation-for-effective-marketing-decisions

The aim of the customer segmentation project is to divide customers into different groups based on their common characteristics and behaviour. This allows businesses to better understand the needs and preferences of each group, and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. By analyzing customer data, which often includes various demographic and behavioural characteristics such as age, profession, and family size, businesses can identify patterns and trends among different customer groups.

Data visualization techniques can be used to explore the relationships among different customer features, and help businesses identify key characteristics that can be used to segment customers. Machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the customer data to automatically classify customers into different segments based on their shared characteristics.
