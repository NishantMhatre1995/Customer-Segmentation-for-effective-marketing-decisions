# Customer-Segmentation-for-effective-marketing-decisions

### What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

In business-to-business marketing, a company might segment customers according to a wide range of factors, including:

Industry
Number of employees
Products previously purchased from the company
Location
In business-to-consumer marketing, companies often segment customers according to demographics that include:

Age
Gender
Marital status
Location (urban, suburban, rural)
Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.)
Why Segment Customers?
Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests, instead).
Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment.
Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities.
Establish better customer relationships.
Test pricing options.
Focus on the most profitable customers.
Improve customer service.
Upsell and cross-sell other products and services.


The aim of the customer segmentation project is to divide customers into different groups based on their common characteristics and behaviour. This allows businesses to better understand the needs and preferences of each group, and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. By analyzing customer data, which often includes various demographic and behavioural characteristics such as age, profession, and family size, businesses can identify patterns and trends among different customer groups.

Data visualization techniques can be used to explore the relationships among different customer features, and help businesses identify key characteristics that can be used to segment customers. Machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the customer data to automatically classify customers into different segments based on their shared characteristics.
